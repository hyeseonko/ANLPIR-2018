### Implementing and extending state of the art QA neural networks.
 
The goal of this project is to being able to read a research paper, implement and extend state-of-the-art neural network for QA.

For the project a student choses among different research papers:

- [Learning to rank short text pairs with convolutional deep neural networks](http://eecs.csuohio.edu/~sschung/CIS660/RankShortTextCNNACM2015.pdf) (**Difficulty**: 1/5, **Extensions**: required, **features/layer ablation**: required)

- [Attentive Pooling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03609) (**Difficulty**: 3/5, **Extensions**: optional, **feature/layer ablation**: required)

- [A Compare-Aggregate Model for Matching Text Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01747) (**Difficulty**: 4/5, **Extensions**: optional, **feature/layer ablation**: required)



**Difficulty**: high difficulty indicates that the model is difficult to implement, replicate (obtaining the same results). Difficulty is taken in account in the evaluation (e.g. a model with 4/5 is correctly implemented, a complete analysis of feature and layer ablation is done, and the student didn't achieved the result reported in the paper. The student can still get full mark) we are in fact evaluating the methodology not the actual score.

**Extensions**: more trivial models or models that have implementation available online extensions are required. Extensions can range from adding features, adding/removing/substituting layers.

**Feature/Layer ablation tests** Each layer or features that contributes to the final results should be evaluated by replacing or deling it and empirically evaluate the results against the original layer.


If the student wants to propose a different paper even on another task, or needs suggestions can contact me at **d.bonadiman -at- unitn.it**
